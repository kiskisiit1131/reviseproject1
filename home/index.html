          <p>Currently, I am an undergrad student at Illinois Institute of Technology, and working towards my Bachelor's degree in Applied Science: Information Technology and Management. 
          I am pursuing my Master's degree as well, although undecided on whether I want to specialize in Cyber Security or continue on with Information Technology and Management.</p>

          <p> I am currently enrolled in a Web Design class and have created a Git Hub repository to store all of my work. We are just starting out with HTML and will continue
          on to learn CSS to build on our knowledge of Web Design. The Git Hub logo below links to my Web Design Repository.</p>
